# LatentVelo

Estimating RNA velocity in a learned latent space, enabling batch correction and dynamics based embeddings.

Pre-print available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.22.504858v1

Full code coming soon! In the examples/ directory we show a few examples of the model for RNA velocity and batch correction.
